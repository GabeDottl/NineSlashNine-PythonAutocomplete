if stmt:
  create a ReferenceAssignment, if necessary
  Create a CFGNode

What's in a CFGNode / what does it represent? A line of code? A statement?



CFGNode:
 Stmt
 Class Def
 While
 For
 If
 Try
 With

Creating graph:
  For each of the above, create a Node.
  In the node, maintain a copy of the reference-assignment table

* Scopes
* Control Flow
* Namespaces
* Stack

In essence, I'm trying to create a sort of pseudo-interpreter which goes through
all or most paths to derive values and/or types (or a set of these)
for various things.

First:
Traverse tree
  For each simple_stmt, create a CFGNode
    simple_stmt may contain a ReferenceAssignment for a local (or nonlocal or global) or an expression



Essentially, want a graph I can traverse assigning values to names so that at
any arbitrary location in a file, I can essentially query what an identifiers
likely values are.
